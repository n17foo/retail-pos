# RetailPOS

**The all-in-one Point of Sale system that connects your physical store to your online shop.**

Whether you run a coffee shop, a boutique, a restaurant, or a warehouse — RetailPOS gives your team one screen to sell, track inventory, and manage orders across every channel. It works on iPads, Android tablets, desktop computers, and in any web browser.

## What RetailPOS Does

### Sell in Person

Ring up customers fast. Your product catalogue loads instantly with pictures, categories, and prices. Staff tap a product, adjust quantities, apply discounts, and check out — all in a few seconds.

### Accept Any Payment

Swipe, tap, or dip a card. RetailPOS integrates with **Worldpay**, **Stripe**, and **Square** so you can choose the payment provider that works best for your business. Cash payments are supported too.

### Stay in Sync with Your Online Store

Already selling online? Connect RetailPOS to your existing e-commerce store and your products, inventory, and orders stay in sync automatically:

| Platform | What Syncs |
|---|---|
| **Shopify** | Products, inventory, orders |
| **WooCommerce** | Products, inventory, orders |
| **BigCommerce** | Products, inventory, orders |
| **Magento** | Products, inventory, orders |
| **Wix** | Products, inventory, orders |
| **PrestaShop** | Products, inventory, orders |
| **Squarespace** | Products, inventory, orders |
| **Sylius** | Products, inventory, orders |

Don't have an online store? No problem — choose **Offline Mode** during setup and manage everything locally on the device.

### Track Inventory in Real Time

Every sale automatically updates your stock counts. Get low-stock alerts before you run out. If you sell the same products online and in-store, inventory stays accurate across both channels.

### Manage Your Team

Create accounts for every employee with a simple 6-digit PIN login. Assign roles that control what each person can do:

| Role | Can Do |
|---|---|
| **Admin** | Everything — settings, reports, refunds, user management |
| **Manager** | Products, reports, refunds, daily operations |
| **Cashier** | Ring up sales, search products, basic operations |

### Print Receipts

Connect a thermal receipt printer over USB, Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi. Receipts are generated automatically at checkout with your store name, items, totals, and payment details.

### Scan Barcodes

Use your device's camera or a Bluetooth barcode scanner to quickly find products and add them to the cart.

### Process Refunds

Handle returns directly from the POS. Refunds are processed back through the original payment method and, if connected, synced to your online store.

### Works Everywhere

| Device | How |
|---|---|
| **iPad / iPhone** | Native app via Expo Go or standalone build |
| **Android tablet / phone** | Native app via Expo Go or standalone build |
| **Desktop (Mac, Windows, Linux)** | Electron app with full hardware support |
| **Web browser** | Any modern browser — nothing to install |

### Works Offline

Orders, products, and user data are stored locally on the device. If your internet drops, you can keep selling. Data syncs automatically when the connection comes back.

### Multiple Languages

The interface is available in English, Spanish, French, and German. The language is detected automatically from the device, or can be changed in settings.
